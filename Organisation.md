## Ideation

It's a game.
You are a Skeleton Summoning.
You have to summon Towers until you win.
It aims to be an RPG Tower Defense Game.

The technology mainly involves Blender for 3D modeling, texturing, rigging, and animation.
For game development, I use JavaScript.
It's still undecided whether to go with Three.js or Babylon.js for the Augmented Reality aspect. If AR doesn't work well, then it becomes a game.
If time is available, I will integrate web3 functionality and introduce ownership of the players' assets.

Let's come up with a story

### Story

There is Sketo, the great summoning mage of Waro.
Waro is a world of anger and death, with death in every corner.

The citizens of Waro are seeking joy and peace deeply.
They protect their world as best as they can to create peace and harmony and make room for inventions and leisure time.

Every now and then, they get ported to different environments, an anomaly that no one can explain so far.

Currently, we are in the year 2024 of Waro.
On a sunny evening, the porting unexpectedly happens.
They appear in the world of Earth in the middle of a small village in Germany.
A gigantic creature stands in front of them, and they don't know if he is peace-oriented or, as usual, looking for a fight and conquest.
So they prepare for upcoming events.

Let's prepare ⚒️
